        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            If your weather is still cool, snowy, rainy, and dreary in early spring like it is here in Southern Ontario (we’re getting a snowstorm later today…*cries*), I hope you’ll enjoy this comforting soup. Even if it’s not cold where you are, I’d argue that breaking out into a light sweat while eating this is totally worth it!
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons (22.5 mL) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cups (280 grams) diced onion (1 medium/large)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>1 (14-ounce/398 mL) can diced tomatoes, with juices</li>
            <li>1 (14-ounce/398 mL) can full-fat coconut milk*</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (140 grams) uncooked red lentils, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>1/2 c. cranberries</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups (875 mL) low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper, to taste (for a kick of heat!)</li>
            <li>1 (5-ounce/140-gram) package baby spinach</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons (10 mL) fresh lime juice, or more to taste</li>            
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, add the oil, onion, and garlic. Add a pinch of salt, stir, and sauté over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes until the onion softens.</li>
            <li>Stir in the turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, and cardamom until combined. Continue cooking for about 1 minute, until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the diced tomatoes (with juices), entire can of coconut milk, red lentils, broth, salt, and plenty of pepper. Add red pepper flakes or cayenne, if desired, to taste. Stir to combine. Increase heat to high and bring to a low boil.</li>
            <li>Once it boils, reduce the heat to medium-high, and simmer, uncovered, for about 18 to 22 minutes, until the lentils are fluffy and tender.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and stir in the spinach until wilted. Add the lime juice to taste. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if desired. Ladle into bowls and serve with toasted bread and lime wedges.</li>
        </ol>
