        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            If you’re not a fan of seafood, this recipe can easily be turned into a vegan japchae by omitting the seafood. Likewise, if you don’t like spicy food, simply omit the gochugaru (Korean red chili pepper flakes) for a mild seafood japchae.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces dangmyeon 당면 (Korean sweet potato starch noodles)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable or canola oil)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>▢1/2 to 1 tablespoon gochugaru preferably finely ground</li>
            <li>8 small shrimp peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1/4 medium onion thinly sliced</li>
            <li>⅓ small carrot cut into matchsticks</li>
            <li>2 to 3 fresh shiitake mushrooms or mushrooms of your choice, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>▢2 ounces enoki mushrooms - optional</li>
            <li>1 scallion sliced diagonally</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1-1/2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>                      
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the noodles in warm water until soft (about 30 to 40 minutes), and drain.</li>
            <li>Clean the shrimp and squid. Cut the squid into bite size pieces.</li>
            <li>Prepare the vegetables, and mix all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the vegetable oil, sesame oil, and the gochugaru to a pan, and heat until hot over medium low heat, stirring. Remove from the heat as soon as the oil starts to turn red and the chili pepper flakes become a bit pasty. Do not burn the gochugaru.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat to medium, and add the noodles to the pan along with 1-1/2 tablespoons of the prepared sauce. Stir-fry until the noodles are soft, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the noodles onto a plate. In the same pan, stir fry the onion for a minute, and then carrot and mushrooms until wilted. Add a tablespoon of water if the vegetables look dry. Lightly season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add the seafood and the remaining sauce, and stir-fry until the seafood is cooked through. Follow this by the scallion and optional enoki mushrooms until the scallions are slightly wilted.</li>
            <li>Return the noodles to the pan, and toss everything well together. You can add a bit more sugar and/or soy sauce to taste.</li>            
        </ol>
